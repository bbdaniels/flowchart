{title:Description}

{p}Given an Excel spreadsheet with columns A, B, C, and D titled “logic”, “var”, “stat” and “value”, respectively, {cmd:flowChart} replaces the “value” column with the requested statistic for the observations in the dataset that fit the condition expressed in “logic”. This allows for the creation of dynamically updating custom tables and flowcharts.
